Regions in AWS generally don't matter, long as I am not dealing with VPC stuff.

arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:565166169329:function:Calc

Wonder what the above is.

API Gateway is a quick way to write REST API for me to use.
Where API Gateway can be interacted via like the below:

https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}/

Where I just have to provide some URL queries, then, it gives me an JSON object.

Completely stuck on step 7 for API Gateway section.
