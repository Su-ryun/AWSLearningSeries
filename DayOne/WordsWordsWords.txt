Essentially, when I compare and contrast between AWS Lambda and Docker,
AWS Lambda is a Docker without me needing to write Docker files.

Turns out, when they are talking about serverless, they are talking
about serverless for the end users.

When they are talking about stateless, they are talking 
about your app not needing to persist states.

All Lambda logs are stored in CloudWatch.

Within the world of Incognito, every app has their id, where 
you use the id to interacte with the API's those are specific
to your app.
